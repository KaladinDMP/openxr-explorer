# valid one will be used.
# Format is:
# [OS id: windows|linux] [name, no space] [path, spaces are ok]

# Windows needs the path to the runtime's json file

# Linux needs the name of the runtime's installed .so file,
# but if you use a specific path to a .so, that'll work too.
# openxr-explorer will replace ~ with the HOME path on Linux.
